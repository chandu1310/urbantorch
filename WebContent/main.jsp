	One of two things is going to happen in 2012: either the world is going to end as the Mayans predicted, or people are finally going to start to see enterprise software as cool (which I have long predicted).  Now, most people will never think enterprise software is as sweet as I do; I can live with that.  Services that help you access the world’s music or connect with your entire network of friends will always win the technology popularity contest.  But we do spend an awful lot of time talking about coupons, randomized video chat (likely NSFW), and virtual bars.  I mean, these are totally cool areas of innovation, but when compared to $3.4B software acquisitions and SaaS stocks up 60%, or over-performing IPOs and more rumored to come, I’m not sure the world of enterprise software is that lacking in spice.
